# Sapient

This a basic IT Programming Test, built on Java 8.

To execute Java 8 is required.

EXERCISE ONE:
Leet: L37'5 h4v3 50m3 fun.
Replace letters in a string with the mapping below:
[a,A] -> 4
[e,E] -> 3
[i,I] -> 1
[o,O] -> 0
[s,S] -> 5
[t,T] -> 7
[b,D] -> 5
Note: [o,O] is not an owl face, it's the letter "o" and it should be replaced with a zero.
Objective: to convert a String into Leet.

EXERCISE TWO:
String: Manipulate strings with repeating characters aaabbbbccccc > a3b4c5
Objective: Take each repeated letter in a string, and re-arrange the string so each letter in the
string is shown once along with the number of times it is repeated. Do this serialized for each
instance of any letter, and not for the total number of times that letter is shown in the string.
